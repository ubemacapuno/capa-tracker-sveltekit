## CAPA Tracker:

Document and track CAPA reports with CAPA Tracker! This full-stack application allows users to create CAPA records, add information, update information, and delete entries.

## What are CAPAs?:

CAPA stands for Corrective And Preventive Action, and is a process by which a manufacturing organization can make improvements to reduce non-conformances and process gaps. My background is in pharmaceutical and medical device quality assurance, and CAPA processes are required by the FDA in these industries. CAPA Tracker is an app that can help document and keep track of your organization's CAPAs! Read more about CAPAs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrective_and_preventive_action">HERE</a>.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** 

Front-end: SvelteKit, Tailwind/DaisyUI

Back-end: TBD

# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
